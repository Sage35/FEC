hey yall, welcome to my ted talk.

General:

  the basic format of any API request should look like this: 'https://app-hrsei-api.herokuapp.com/api/fec2/hrnyc/...'


  every API request should also have a header with key 'AUTHORIZATION' and value of your github token

Products:
  the basic format of a products API request should look like this: 'https://app-hrsei-api.herokuapp.com/api/fec2/hrnyc/products/'

  you can set query parameters for the number of products returned or the page of the results (i.e. 'products/?count=30')

  to get data for an individual product id, you just add the id to the end of the request (i.e. 'products/11001')

  to get the styles or related products for a specific product, you just add 'styles' or 'related' to the end of the request (i.e. 'products/11001/styles')

Reviews:
  the basic format of a reviews API request should look like this: 'https://app-hrsei-api.herokuapp.com/api/fec2/hrnyc/reviews/?product_id=11001'

    note that you can't make a request for reviews without first specifying the product id as a query parameter

  you can further add query parameters to specify page and count (like with products), as well as sort!!!, which takes in "newest", "helpful", or "relevant" as parameters (i.e. 'reviews/?product_id=11001&sort=helpful')

  you can also get the review metadata by just adding 'meta' to the end of the request (i.e. 'reviews/meta/?product_id=11001')

Questions:
  the basic format of a questions API request should look like this 'https://app-hrsei-api.herokuapp.com/api/fec2/hrnyc/qa/questions/?product_id=11001'

    like with reviews, you can't make a request for questions without first specifying the product id as a query parameter

  as before, you can use query paramaters to set count and page

  in order to get the answers to a specific question, you need to add the question id to the end of the request, followed by 'answers' (i.e. 'qa/questions/47542/answers')

    you need the question id in order to get answers

  answers can also use query paramaters to set count and page
